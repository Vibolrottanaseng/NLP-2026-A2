### Dataset
I use *Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland* by Lewis Carroll,
sourced from Project Gutenberg.
 
Project Gutenberg provides public-domain literary works.
The dataset was selected because it is text-rich, narrative-based,
and suitable for training a language model to learn story-like
text generation.
